  <h2>General</h2>
     <p>I am 21 years old and currently studying my first year in NMD.</p>
  <h3>Why NMD?</h3>
     <p>The programme seemed fun. Also, it was the only one of my options that kept <br>
        popping up in my head. So far, I would say that I have made the right choice. </p>
  <h4>Interests</h4>
     <p>I tend to get bored quite quickly. My solution to this is to collect some 'coping mechanisms'<br>
        However, if you ask me in a random conversation, I will most likely have forgotten everything <br>
        I have listed on this website. </p>
     <ul>
        <li> Play instuments </li>
        <li> Dance </li>
        <li> Hang out with friends </li>
        <li> Bake </li>
     </ul>
